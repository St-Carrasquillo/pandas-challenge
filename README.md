# PyCity Schools Analysis

## With PyCity Schools, charter schools have more successful students. This suggests a potential efficiency or effectiveness in resource utilization within charter schools.

* Spending didn't impact student success as charter schools we're all in the 2 lower buckets of spending per student.
* Size of schools could be a contributing factor as, lowest performing schools had 2900+ students. (All district schools)
* Grade level doesn't impact spending as all schools had each grade level's passing rate around the same %.
* Top 5 schools were all charter vs lowest 5 all being district.
