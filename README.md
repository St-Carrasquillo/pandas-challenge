# pandas-challenge
In this assignment, Iâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
I used the provided starter code and made some additional changes besides adding the required coding. 
- I rounded all percentages to show 2 decimal points to make the numbers quicker/ easier to read.
- I also ran into an issue when grouping data into spending per student bins. Due to a foremating issue I had to add in additional coding to reformate the spending per student column to just numbers removing the currency formating. 


# PyCity Schools Analysis

## With PyCity Schools, charter schools have more successful students. This suggests a potential efficiency or effectiveness in resource utilization within charter schools.

* Spending didn't impact student success as charter schools we're all in the 2 lower buckets of spending per student.
* Size of schools could be a contributing factor as, lowest performing schools had 2900+ students. (All district schools)
* Grade level doesn't impact spending as all schools had each grade level's passing rate around the same %.
* Top 5 schools were all charter vs lowest 5 all being district.
